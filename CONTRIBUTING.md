### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## What should I know before I get started?

If you need help with development, want to discuss a new feature or improvement please open a new issue with the [feature proposal template](.github/FEATURE_PROPOSAL_TEMPLATE.md).

As a basic rule, before filing issues, feature requests or anything else. Take a look at the issues and check if this has not already been reported by another user. If so, engage in the already existing discussion.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a
   build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files, README.md, and the CHANGELOG.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. Your Pull Request would be merged once we have reviewed your code contribution
5. Please follow the specified [Pull Request](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) format, while sending in your PR
6. Mention the issue ID that your PR fixes, so that once your PR is merged, the issue gets closed automatically
